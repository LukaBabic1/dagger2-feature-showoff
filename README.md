# dagger2-feature-showoff

## Intro
Although Dagger2 is no longer hot topic among developers, I always found it frustrating
that even official documentation is lacking deep insight of what Dagger can actually do and what
are the small details that everyone should be aware of when using Dagger.

## Goal of project
Main goal of this project is not to show how Dagger should be set up for an Android project or any 
other framework (for example, JavaFX GUI app). 

On the contrary, the idea is to show how Dagger works on simplest application stack as possible. 
In this case, plain command line app.
